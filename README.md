## 🧩 Project Architecture

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Collected 1L+ jewelry images from the Tanishq dataset.  
   - Preprocessed and resized images for uniform model input.

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Used a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet50) for image embeddings.  
   - Stored embeddings for similarity computation.

3. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - Computed cosine similarity to recommend visually similar items.

4. **Deployment**  
   - Developed an interactive UI with Streamlit.  
   - Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for public access.
